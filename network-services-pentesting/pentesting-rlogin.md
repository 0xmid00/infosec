## Basic Information

In the past, **rlogin** was widely utilized for remote administration tasks. However, due to concerns regarding its security, it has largely been superseded by **slogin** and **ssh**. These newer methods provide enhanced security for remote connections.

**Default port:** 513

```
PORT    STATE SERVICE
513/tcp open  login
```

#### Access Control & Trusted Relationships

The primary concern for `r-services`, and one of the primary reasons `SSH` was introduced to replace it, is the inherent issues regarding access control for these protocols. R-services rely on trusted information sent from the remote client to the host machine they are attempting to authenticate to. By default, these services utilize [Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM)](https://debathena.mit.edu/trac/wiki/PAM) for user authentication onto a remote system; however, they also bypass this authentication through the use of the `/etc/hosts.equiv` and `.rhosts` files on the system. The `hosts.equiv` and `.rhosts` files contain a list of hosts (`IPs` or `Hostnames`) and users that are `trusted` by the local host when a connection attempt is made using `r-commands`. Entries in either file can appear like the following:

**Note:** The `hosts.equiv` file is recognized as the global configuration regarding all users on a system, whereas `.rhosts` provides a per-user configuration.

#### Sample .rhosts File

Linux Remote Management Protocols

```shell-session
0xmid00@htb[/htb]$ cat .rhosts

htb-student     10.0.17.5
+               10.0.17.10
+               +
```

As we can see from this example, both files follow the specific syntax of `<username> <ip address>` or `<username> <hostname>` pairs. Additionally, the `+` modifier can be used within these files as a wildcard to specify anything. In this example, the `+` modifier allows any external user to access r-commands from the `htb-student` user account via the host with the IP address `10.0.17.10`.

Misconfigurations in either of these files can allow an attacker to authenticate as another user without credentials, with the potential for gaining code execution. Now that we understand how we can potentially abuse misconfigurations in these files let's attempt to try logging into a target host using `rlogin`.

#### Logging in Using Rlogin

Linux Remote Management Protocols

```shell-session
0xmid00@htb[/htb]$ rlogin 10.0.17.2 -l htb-student

Last login: Fri Dec  2 16:11:21 from localhost

[htb-student@localhost ~]$
```

We have successfully logged in under the `htb-student` account on the remote host due to the misconfigurations in the `.rhosts` file. Once successfully logged in, we can also abuse the `rwho` command to list all interactive sessions on the local network by sending requests to the UDP port 513.

#### Listing Authenticated Users Using Rwho

Linux Remote Management Protocols

```shell-session
0xmid00@htb[/htb]$ rwho

root     web01:pts/0 Dec  2 21:34
htb-student     workstn01:tty1  Dec  2 19:57  2:25       
```

From this information, we can see that the `htb-student` user is currently authenticated to the `workstn01` host, whereas the `root` user is authenticated to the `web01` host. We can use this to our advantage when scoping out potential usernames to use during further attacks on hosts over the network. However, the `rwho` daemon periodically broadcasts information about logged-on users, so it might be beneficial to watch the network traffic.

#### Listing Authenticated Users Using Rusers

To provide additional information in conjunction with `rwho`, we can issue the `rusers` command. This will give us a more detailed account of all logged-in users over the network, including information such as the username, hostname of the accessed machine, TTY that the user is logged in to, the date and time the user logged in, the amount of time since the user typed on the keyboard, and the remote host they logged in from (if applicable).

Linux Remote Management Protocols

```shell-session
0xmid00@htb[/htb]$ rusers -al 10.0.17.5

htb-student     10.0.17.5:console          Dec 2 19:57     2:25
```

## **Login**

```bash
# Install client
apt-get install rsh-client
```

You can use the following command to try to **login** to a remote host where **no password** is required for access. Try using **root** is as username:

```bash
rlogin <IP> -l <username>
```

### [Brute force](../generic-methodologies-and-resources/brute-force.md#rlogin)

## Find files

```
find / -name .rhosts
```
