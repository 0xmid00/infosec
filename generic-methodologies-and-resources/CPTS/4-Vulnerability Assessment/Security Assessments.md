# Security Assessments Overview

Organizations must regularly perform security assessments on their networks, systems, and applications to identify vulnerabilities and mitigate potential threats.

## 🔍 Types of Security Assessments

### 1. **Vulnerability Assessment**

- **Purpose:** Identify and confirm known vulnerabilities.
    
- **Method:** Based on security standards and compliance checklists.
    
- **Applicability:** Suitable for all organizations.
    
- **Output:** Reports vulnerabilities without exploiting them.
    

### 2. **Penetration Testing (Pentesting)**

- **Purpose:** Simulate real-world cyberattacks to evaluate security.
    
- **Method:** Ethical hackers test systems with permission.
    
- **Types:**
    
    - **Black Box:** No prior knowledge.
        
    - **Grey Box:** Limited knowledge (e.g., non-IT employee access).
        
    - **White Box:** Full access to systems and code.
        
- **Specializations:**
    
    - **Application Pentesting:** Web, APIs, mobile apps.
        
    - **Network Pentesting:** Routers, servers, AD, etc.
        
    - **Physical Pentesting:** Testing physical security (e.g., tailgating).
        
    - **Social Engineering:** Phishing, vishing, impersonation.
        

> **Note:** Best for organizations with medium to high security maturity.

## 🔄 Vulnerability Assessment vs. Penetration Testing

|**Aspect**|**Vulnerability Assessment**|**Penetration Test**|
|---|---|---|
|**Goal**|Identify known vulnerabilities|Simulate attacks to exploit vulnerabilities|
|**Effort**|Lower, often automated|Higher, requires manual and automated techniques|
|**Expertise**|Less technical skill required|High technical skill required|
|**Results**|Checklist-based, may miss complex issues|In-depth analysis, real-world attack chains|
|**Cost**|Lower|Higher|

> Use both methods together for a comprehensive security posture.

## 🧾 Other Security Assessment Types

### 3. **Security Audits**

- **Purpose:** Ensure compliance with external regulations.
    
- **Examples:** PCI-DSS for credit card transactions.
    
- **Conducted by:** Government or industry bodies.
    

### 4. **Bug Bounty Programs**

- **Purpose:** Publicly invite ethical hackers to find bugs.
    
- **Rewards:** Monetary compensation for valid findings.
    
- **Ideal for:** High-security maturity organizations (e.g., Microsoft, Apple).
    

### 5. **Red Team Assessments**

- **Purpose:** Advanced simulation by experienced offensive security teams.
    
- **Goal:** Mimic real attackers to test defense capabilities.
    
- **Ideal for:** Large, security-mature organizations.
