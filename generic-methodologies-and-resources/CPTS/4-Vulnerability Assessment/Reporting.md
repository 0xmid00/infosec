Soft skills are just as important as technical skills in information security. Even though tools automate vulnerability scanning, you still need to create a clear, client-ready report. The report must be easy to understand for both technical and non-technical readers. A strong report generally includes:

- Executive Summary
    
- Overview of Assessment
    
- Scope and Duration
    
- Vulnerabilities and Recommendations
    

### Executive Summary

This section is designed for executives. It provides a high-level overview and highlights the most critical issues that need immediate attention. You can also add visual aids, such as a bar chart showing the number of vulnerabilities categorized by severity (e.g., 2 critical, 4 high, 3 medium, 1 low).

### Overview of Assessment

Here you describe the methodology used during the assessment. Explain the steps taken, tools used (for example, Nessus), and the overall testing approach.

### Scope and Duration

List everything that was in-scope for the assessment. Mention authorized targets, IP addresses, URLs, networks, and define the testing period.

### Vulnerabilities and Recommendations

This is the core of your report. After removing any false positives, you should present each finding clearly. For each vulnerability, include:

- Vulnerability Name
    
- CVE Identifier
    
- CVSS Score
    
- Description of the Issue
    
- References (official docs, advisories)
    
- Remediation Steps (how to fix it)
    
- Proof of Concept (evidence of the issue)
    
- Affected Systems (what machines or services)
    

### Final Tips

The report is the most critical part of the assessment. Make sure it is easy to understand. Use clear language, proper grammar, and be direct. Always explain technical terms when possible so that non-technical readers can follow. Strong reports are short, accurate, and clear.

Now, here’s an **example report** using that same style:

## Vulnerability Assessment Report for Acme Corp

### Executive Summary

During the vulnerability assessment of Acme Corp’s public-facing infrastructure, we discovered several vulnerabilities that could impact system security if left unaddressed. We recommend prioritizing the remediation of critical and high-severity findings immediately.

Summary of Findings:

- Critical Vulnerabilities: 2
    
- High Vulnerabilities: 4
    
- Medium Vulnerabilities: 3
    
- Low Vulnerabilities: 1
    

### Overview of Assessment

The assessment was conducted using the Nessus Professional vulnerability scanner and manual verification techniques. Scans were performed on external IP addresses authorized by Acme Corp, followed by manual validation to eliminate false positives.

### Scope and Duration

- Assessment Period: March 1, 2025 – March 5, 2025
    
- In-Scope Assets:
    
    - Web server: 172.16.16.100
        
    - Mail server: 172.16.16.150
        
- Methodologies: Automated vulnerability scanning and manual verification
    

### Vulnerabilities and Recommendations

**Vulnerability Name**: Remote Code Execution via Outdated Apache Struts  
**CVE**: CVE-2017-5638  
**CVSS**: 10.0 (Critical)
