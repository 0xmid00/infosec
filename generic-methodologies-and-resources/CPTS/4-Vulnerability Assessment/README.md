## [[Security Assessments]]

Every organization must perform different types of `Security assessments` on their `networks`, `computers`, and `applications` at least every so often. The primary purpose of most types of security assessments is to find and confirm vulnerabilities are present, so we can work to `patch`, `mitigate`, or `remove` them. There are different ways and methodologies to test how secure a computer system is. Some types of security assessments are more appropriate for certain networks than others. But they all serve a purpose in improving cybersecurity. All organizations have different compliance requirements and risk tolerance, face different threats, and have different business models that determine the types of systems they run externally and internally. Some organizations have a much more mature security posture than their peers and can focus on advanced red team simulations conducted by third parties, while others are still working to establish baseline security. Regardless, all organizations must stay on top of both legacy and recent vulnerabilities and have a system for detecting and mitigating risks to their systems and data.

## Vulnerability Scanning Overview

Vulnerability scanning helps detect known flaws in systems, applications, and network devices.  
It uses automated tools (e.g., Nessus, OpenVAS) to identify issues without actively exploiting them.  
Scans can be static (based on version/CVE) or dynamic (using payloads like SQLi).  
Both authenticated and unauthenticated scans are recommended regularly.  
Popular tools include Nessus, Qualys, Nexpose, and OpenVAS.
## Getting started with Nussus 

To download Nessus, we can navigate to its [Download Page](https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus?loginAttempted=true) to download the correct Nessus binary for our system, Next, we can visit the [Activation Code Page](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/activation-code) to request a Nessus Activation Code, next 
```bash
sudo systemctl start nessusd.service
dpkg -i Nessus-8.15.1-ubuntu910_amd64.deb
```
To access Nessus, we can navigate to `https://localhost:8834`
## Nessus Setting And Scanning 

### New Scan
To initiate a new Nessus scan, click "New Scan" and select the scan type from three categories: Discovery, Vulnerabilities, and Compliance. You can select scan types like Basic Network Scan, Advanced Scan, Malware Scan, and Web Application Tests, among others. Once the scan is configured, you can enter the target (e.g., `172.16.16.100` for Windows).

### Discovery
Discovery settings allow scanning for live hosts, open ports, and specific device types. Options include scanning common ports or a custom range. Service discovery probes all ports and identifies SSL/TLS services, and you can enable web application scanning.

### Assessment
Nessus allows web application scanning, credentialed scanning, and brute-force attacks using provided credentials. Techniques like RID Brute Forcing for user enumeration can also be enabled.

### Advanced
The "Advanced" tab offers performance settings, including safe checks to prevent impacting the target device. It also supports scanning in random order and stopping unresponsive hosts.

### Scan Policies
Nessus lets you create custom scan policies, which can be saved and reused. You can define specific settings, plugins, and compliance standards for tailored scans.

### Nessus Plugins
Nessus uses plugins written in NASL to detect vulnerabilities. These plugins cover a wide range of CVEs and are categorized by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info). Custom rules can be created to exclude certain false positives.

### Scanning with Credentials
Nessus supports credentialed scanning using various authentication methods (SSH, Windows, databases). It allows for authenticated scans with Linux or Windows credentials to improve vulnerability detection.

### Working with Nessus Scan Output
Once a scan is complete, you can export the results in multiple formats (.pdf, .html, .csv). The reports provide detailed information about vulnerabilities, and can be exported for analysis in tools like Splunk. Scan results can also be exported as `.nessus` or `.db` files for further processing.

### Exporting Nessus Scans
You can export scan results in formats like `.nessus` or `.db`. Nessus also provides a script for downloading reports via the REST API for quick access.

or use  Scripts such as the [nessus-report-downloader](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eelsivart/nessus-report-downloader/master/nessus6-report-downloader.rb) can be used to quickly download scan results in all available formats from the CLI using the Nessus REST AP

# OpenVAS

### OpenVAS Overview
OpenVAS by Greenbone Networks is a free and publicly available vulnerability scanner. It is part of the Greenbone Vulnerability Manager (GVM) and can perform both authenticated and unauthenticated network scans.

### Scans Overview
Scans can be accessed from the Scans tab, where you can view previous scans or create new tasks. Scans typically take 1–2 hours to complete. It's recommended to review vulnerabilities as they appear instead of waiting for the scan to finish.

The Windows target IP is 172.16.16.100 and the Linux target IP is 172.16.16.160 for this module.

### Configuration
Before scanning, targets must be configured under the Configurations tab. You can add a single target or a list of hosts, set port options, authentication, and how to check if a host is alive (using NVT Ping Host).

For authenticated scans, high-privilege credentials are used:
- Linux credentials: htb-student_adm / HTB_@cademy_student!
- Windows credentials: administrator / Academy_VA_adm1!

Targets will appear in the list once added.

### Scan Configurations
Several scanning profiles are available:
- **Base**: Gathers host and OS info (no vulnerability checks).
- **Discovery**: Identifies services, ports, hardware, software (no vulnerability checks).
- **Host Discovery**: Tests if hosts are alive using ping (no vulnerability checks).
- **System Discovery**: Deeper system enumeration (more detailed than Discovery).
- **Full and Fast**: Recommended, uses smart NVT checks based on open ports.

When creating a new scan, navigate to the Scans tab and use the wizard icon. Scans are configured by setting a target and scan options, and typically take 30–60 minutes to complete.

### Scan Results
After the scan completes, reports are available under the Scans tab. Reports include details like operating system information, open ports, services, and found vulnerabilities.

### Exporting Results
Reports can be exported in XML, CSV, PDF, ITG, and TXT formats. For example, exporting to Excel can be done using:
```bash
python3 -m openvasreporting -i <report>.xml -f xlsx
```
