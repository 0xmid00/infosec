#  Vulnerability Assessment

## Overview
A **Vulnerability Assessment** is a process used to identify, classify, and prioritize security weaknesses in an environment. It does **not typically involve active exploitation** of vulnerabilities but focuses on identifying and recommending remediation strategies.

## Purpose
- Identify obvious vulnerabilities without exploiting them.
- May include light validation for reducing false positives.
- Clarify scope and expectations with stakeholders.
- Supports vulnerability management for prioritizing fixes.

## Methodology (8 Steps)
1. Conduct risk identification and analysis
2. Develop scanning policies
3. Identify scan types
4. Configure the scan
5. Perform the scan
6. Evaluate risks
7. Interpret results
8. Create a remediation plan

## Key Terms
- **Vulnerability**: A flaw that can be exploited (e.g., SQL injection).
- **Threat**: A potential cause of harm (e.g., attacker exploiting SQLi).
- **Exploit**: The actual code/method used to abuse a vulnerability.
- **Risk**: The potential impact if a threat exploits a vulnerability.

**Formula**: Threat + Vulnerability = Risk

**Risk Matrix**: Risk is evaluated by Likelihood Ã— Impact:
- Low likelihood + low impact = Low risk
- High likelihood + high impact = Critical risk

## Asset Management
- **Inventory is essential**: Identify all data assets before securing them.
- **Asset types**:
  - On-prem storage (HDDs, USBs, DVDs, etc.)
  - Cloud storage (AWS, GCP, Azure)
  - SaaS data (Google Drive, Office 365)
  - Local and cloud applications
  - Networking infrastructure (firewalls, routers, IDS/IPS)

- Use asset management tools and data classification.
- Keep the asset inventory updated continuously.
