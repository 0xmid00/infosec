## 📌 Introduction

The **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)** is a standardized framework used across the cybersecurity industry to assess and assign severity scores to software vulnerabilities. Many security tools embed CVSS scores directly into their results, but understanding how they are calculated is vital for accurate risk evaluation.

CVSS often works hand-in-hand with Microsoft's **DREAD** model, a risk assessment system based on:

- **D**amage Potential  
- **R**eproducibility  
- **E**xploitability  
- **A**ffected Users  
- **D**iscoverability

## 🚦 Severity Scoring with CVSS

CVSS scores provide a numerical severity rating based on **Exploitability** and **Impact**:

### ⚙️ CVSS Metrics Overview

- **Base Metric Group**  
- **Temporal Metric Group**  
- **Environmental Metric Group**

## 📊 Base Metric Group

### 🔧 Exploitability Metrics

These evaluate the **technical means** required to exploit a vulnerability:

- **Attack Vector** (Network, Adjacent, Local, Physical)
- **Attack Complexity** (Low or High)
- **Privileges Required** (None, Low, High)
- **User Interaction** (None or Required)

### 💥 Impact Metrics (CIA Triad)

- **Confidentiality Impact**: Is data privacy compromised?
- **Integrity Impact**: Is data modified or corrupted?
- **Availability Impact**: Are resources denied or disrupted?

---

## ⏳ Temporal Metric Group

Evaluates the current exploit landscape and remediation status.

### 💣 Exploit Code Maturity

- **High**: Works reliably with automated tools  
- **Functional**: Publicly available exploit code  
- **Proof-of-Concept**: Requires modification  
- **Unproven**: No confirmed exploitation  
- **Not Defined**: Metric skipped  

### 🛠️ Remediation Level

- **Official Fix**: Vendor patch released  
- **Temporary Fix**: Interim solution by vendor  
- **Workaround**: Unofficial workaround available  
- **Unavailable**: No known fix  
- **Not Defined**: Metric skipped  

### 🧾 Report Confidence

- **Confirmed**: Verified by multiple sources  
- **Reasonable**: Public info exists but not complete  
- **Unknown**: Uncertain details  
- **Not Defined**: Metric skipped  

---

## 🌐 Environmental Metric Group

These are **organization-specific metrics** based on the CIA triad.

### 🧬 Modified Base Metrics

- **Confidentiality / Integrity / Availability Requirement**  
- Metric values:  
  - **High**: Severe organizational impact  
  - **Medium**: Moderate organizational impact  
  - **Low**: Minor organizational impact  
  - **Not Defined**: Skipped metric

## ✅ Summary

| Metric Group  | Focus Area                    |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Base          | Vulnerability attributes      |
| Temporal      | Exploitability & fixes        |
| Environmental | Organization-specific context |

Understanding and manually calculating CVSS helps in **prioritizing vulnerabilities**, **justifying risk assessments**, and **improving overall security posture**.
