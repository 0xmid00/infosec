## 📋 Assessment Standards
- Ensure penetration tests and vulnerability assessments follow defined standards.
- Improve effectiveness, legal acceptance, and reduce risk.

## 🛡️ Compliance Standards
Organizations must meet various compliance standards, including:

### 🔒 PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
- Applies to entities handling cardholder data.
- Enforces segmentation via Cardholder Data Environment (CDE).
- Key Goals: Secure network, protect data, strong access control, regular testing.

### 🏥 HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- Protects patient health data.
- Requires risk assessments, not strictly vulnerability scans.

### 🏛️ FISMA (Federal Information Security Management Act)
- Protects government IT systems.
- Requires documented vulnerability management programs.

### 🌍 ISO 27001
- Global standard for information security.
- Requires internal/external scans and maintaining an Information Security Management System (ISMS).

## 🔐 Penetration Testing Standards
- Requires legal authorization, defined scope, and minimal network disruption.
- Avoid unnecessary changes or data extraction.
