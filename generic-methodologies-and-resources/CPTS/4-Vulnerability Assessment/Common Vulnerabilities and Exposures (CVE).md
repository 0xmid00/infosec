### Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL)
- A security standard used to assess system state and configurations.
- Supported by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and used in NIST’s SCAP framework.
- Automates:
  - Identifying system configurations
  - Evaluating current system state
  - Reporting results (e.g., Vulnerable, Patched, Non-compliant)

**OVAL Definition Classes:**
1. Vulnerability Definitions – Detect known vulnerabilities
2. Compliance Definitions – Check configuration compliance
3. Inventory Definitions – Confirm presence of specific software
4. Patch Definitions – Determine if patches are applied

- Uses XML format.
- OVAL IDs follow the structure: `oval:org.domain:type:value` (e.g., `oval:org.mitre.oval:obj:1116`)
- Tools like Nessus use OVAL for compliance scans.

### Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
- Publicly available catalog of security vulnerabilities.
- Each CVE has a unique identifier and description.
- Managed by the CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs), coordinated by the DHS.

**CVE ID Assignment Process:**
1. Determine if the issue qualifies as a CVE (exploitable code affecting confidentiality, integrity, or availability).
2. Contact the affected product vendor.
3. Identify if the vendor is a CNA or use a third-party CNA.
4. Submit a CVE request using the CVE Web Form.
5. Receive confirmation email from the CVE team.
6. CVE ID assigned (not yet public).
7. Coordinate public disclosure with relevant parties.
8. Announce the CVE.
9. Provide detailed information for the official CVE listing and NVD entry.

**Responsible Disclosure:**
- Encourages researchers to report vulnerabilities to vendors first.
- Ensures patches are available before public disclosure.
- Helps prevent 0-day exploitation.
