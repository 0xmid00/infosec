## Shells Jack Us In, Payloads Deliver Us Shells

A _shell_ is a command-line interface (like Bash, Zsh, cmd, PowerShell) used to interact with a system. In hacking, gaining a shell means getting control of a target system. This is often done by exploiting vulnerabilities.

Why get a shell?

- Direct access to OS and files
- Enables privilege escalation, file transfer, persistence, etc.
- CLI shells are stealthier and easier to automate than GUI access

Types of shells:

- Standard shells (Bash, cmd)
- Web shells (accessed via browser after exploiting web flaws)

_Payloads_ are the code used to exploit systems and deliver shells. They can vary across contexts but in security, they are crafted to gain remote access to systems.
