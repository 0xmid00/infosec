1. The tester initially performed network discovery using Nmap to identify live hosts within the 172.16.5.0/24 network range and discovered several active systems, including the Domain Controller for the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain.

2. The tester then utilized the Responder tool to conduct LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning attacks on the network. As a result, multiple NTLMv2 authentication hashes were captured from domain users attempting to authenticate to the attacker-controlled responder service.

3. The captured NTLMv2 password hashes were successfully cracked offline using the Hashcat tool, revealing the clear text credentials for the domain users **netmonitor** and **svc\_qualys**. These credentials provided the tester with an initial authenticated foothold into the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL Active Directory domain with standard domain user privileges.

4. Using the obtained credentials, the tester conducted further domain enumeration using BloodHound, collecting detailed information about domain users, groups, computers, and permission relationships. Analysis of the BloodHound data revealed several high-privileged domain accounts configured with Service Principal Names (SPNs), making them susceptible to Kerberoasting attacks.

5. The tester leveraged this misconfiguration by performing a targeted Kerberoasting attack using the GetUserSPNs.py tool to request Kerberos TGS service tickets for multiple SPN-enabled accounts, including accounts that were members of highly privileged groups such as **Domain Admins**.

6. The retrieved Kerberos TGS hashes were cracked offline using Hashcat, resulting in the recovery of clear text passwords for multiple service accounts, including the **solarwindsmonitor** account, which was a member of the **Domain Admins** group.

7. With Domain Admin credentials obtained, the tester successfully authenticated to the Domain Controller and was able to fully compromise the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain, enabling complete administrative control over all domain resources and users.
