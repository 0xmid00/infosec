Once registered, we can log in and browse around. We're greeted with our profile page at `http://careers.inlanefreight.local/profile?id=9`.  The ID number  shows us that we can access other users' profiles and see what jobs they applied to. This is a classic example of an `Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)` vulnerability and would definitely be worth reporting due to the potential for sensitive data exposure.
