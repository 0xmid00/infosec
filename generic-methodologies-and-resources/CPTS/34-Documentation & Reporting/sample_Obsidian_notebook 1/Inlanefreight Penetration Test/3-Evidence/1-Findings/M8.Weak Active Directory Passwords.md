## Password Spraying

Another lateral movement technique worth exploring is Password Spraying. We can use [DomainPasswordSpray.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dafthack/DomainPasswordSpray/master/DomainPasswordSpray.ps1) or the Windows version of Kerbrute from the DEV01 host or use Kerbrute from our attack host via Proxychains (all worth playing around with).
