webdev@dmz01:/var/www/html/monitoring$ id

```

Now that we've got a stable reverse shell, we can start digging around the file system. The results of the `id` command are immediately interesting. The [Privileged Groups](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/51/section/477) section of the `Linux Privilege Escalation` module shows an example of users in the `adm` group having rights to read ALL logs stored in `/var/log`. Perhaps we can find something interesting there. We can use [aureport](https://linux.die.net/man/8/aureport) to read audit logs on Linux systems, with the man page describing it as "aureport is a tool that produces summary reports of the audit system logs."

```

After running the command, type `q` to return to our shell. From the above output, it looks like a user was trying to authenticate as the `srvadm` user, and we have a potential credential pair `srvadm:ILFreightnixadm!`. Using the `su` command, we can authenticate as the `srvadm` user.
