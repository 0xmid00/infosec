It's common to find different programming languages installed on the machines we are targetting. Programming languages such as Python, PHP, Perl, and Ruby are commonly available in Linux distributions but can also be installed on Windows, although this is far less common.
We can use some Windows default applications, such as `cscript` and `mshta`, to execute JavaScript or VBScript code. JavaScript can also run on Linux hosts.
According to Wikipedia, there are around [700 programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages), and we can create code in any programing language, to download, upload or execute instructions to the OS.
