## Why Active Directory?
```BASH
## What is Active Directory?
  # AD is a directory service for Windows networks.
  # Provides centralized management for users, computers, groups, policies, file shares, etc.
  # Offers authentication and authorization functions.
  # Built on LDAP, with hierarchy and scalability.

## Why It Matters
  # AD is not secure by default; easy to misconfigure.
  # Even standard domain users can enumerate domain objects.
  # AD is essentially a read-only database to all domain users.

## examples Security Risks
  # Standard domain access is often enough for full domain takeover
  noPAC (2021)
  PrintNightmare (CVE-2021-34527)
  Zerologon (CVE-2020-1472).

## History of Active Directory
  Windows Server 2000 # First AD integration
  Server 2003 # Added Forests (multi-domain grouping)
  Server 2008 # ADFS (Single Sign-On)
  Server 2016
    # Cloud migration capabilities
    # Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA) â€“ mitigates Kerberoasting
    # Azure AD Connect: For Office 365 SSO/cloud integration
```
