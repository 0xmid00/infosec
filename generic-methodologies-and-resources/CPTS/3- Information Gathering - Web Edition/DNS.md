The `hosts` file is located in `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows and in `/etc/hosts` on Linux and MacOS. 
**Why DNS Matters for Web Recon :**
- `Uncovering Assets`: DNS records can reveal a wealth of information, including subdomains, mail servers, and name server records. For instance, a `CNAME` record pointing to an outdated server (`dev.example.com` CNAME `oldserver.example.net`) could lead to a vulnerable system.
- `Mapping the Network Infrastructure`: You can create a comprehensive map of the target's network infrastructure by analysing DNS data. For example, identifying the name servers (`NS` records) for a domain can reveal the hosting provider used, while an `A` record for `loadbalancer.example.com` can pinpoint a load balancer. This helps you understand how different systems are connected, identify traffic flow, and pinpoint potential choke points or weaknesses that could be exploited during a penetration test.
- `Monitoring for Changes`: Continuously monitoring DNS records can reveal changes in the target's infrastructure over time. For example, the sudden appearance of a new subdomain (`vpn.example.com`) might indicate a new entry point into the network, while a `TXT` record containing a value like `_1password=...` strongly suggests the organization is using 1Password, which could be leveraged for social engineering attacks or targeted phishing campaigns.

DNS records store different types of data associated with domain names, each serving a specific purpose:

| Record Type | Full Name                 | Description                                                                                                                                 | Zone File Example                                                                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `A`         | Address Record            | Maps a hostname to its IPv4 address.                                                                                                        | `www.example.com.` IN A `192.0.2.1`                                                            |
| `AAAA`      | IPv6 Address Record       | Maps a hostname to its IPv6 address.                                                                                                        | `www.example.com.` IN AAAA `2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334`                                      |
| `CNAME`     | Canonical Name Record     | Creates an alias for a hostname, pointing it to another hostname.                                                                           | `blog.example.com.` IN CNAME `webserver.example.net.`                                          |
| `MX`        | Mail Exchange Record      | Specifies the mail server(s) responsible for handling email for the domain.                                                                 | `example.com.` IN MX 10 `mail.example.com.`                                                    |
| `NS`        | Name Server Record        | Delegates a DNS zone to a specific authoritative name server.                                                                               | `example.com.` IN NS `ns1.example.com.`                                                        |
| `TXT`       | Text Record               | Stores arbitrary text information, often used for domain verification or security policies.                                                 | `example.com.` IN TXT `"v=spf1 mx -all"` (SPF record)                                          |
| `SOA`       | Start of Authority Record | Specifies administrative information about a DNS zone, including the primary name server, responsible person's email, and other parameters. | `example.com.` IN SOA `ns1.example.com. admin.example.com. 2024060301 10800 3600 604800 86400` |
| `SRV`       | Service Record            | Defines the hostname and port number for specific services.                                                                                 | `_sip._udp.example.com.` IN SRV 10 5 5060 `sipserver.example.com.`                             |
| `PTR`       | Pointer Record            | Used for reverse DNS lookups, mapping an IP address to a hostname.                                                                          | `1.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa.` IN PTR `www.example.com.`                                            |

The "`IN`" in the examples stands for "Internet." It's a class field in DNS records that specifies the protocol family. In most cases, you'll see "`IN`" used, as it denotes the Internet protocol suite (IP) used for most domain names. Other class values exist (e.g., `CH` for Chaosnet, `HS` for Hesiod) but are rarely used in modern DNS configurations.
