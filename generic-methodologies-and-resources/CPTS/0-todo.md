[Six Degrees of Domain Admin](https://youtu.be/wP8ZCczC1OU) from `DEFCON 24` is a great watch for an introduction to BloodHound.  
[Designing AD DACL Backdoors](https://youtu.be/_nGpZ1ydzS8) by Will Schroeder and Andy Robbins is a gem if you haven't seen it.
[Kicking The Guard Dog of Hades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUyhlN-E5MU) is one of the original releases for Kerberoasting and is a great watch. 
In [Kerberoasting 101](https://youtu.be/Jaa2LmZaNeU), Tim Medin does an excellent job dissecting the Kerberoasting attack and how to perform them.
