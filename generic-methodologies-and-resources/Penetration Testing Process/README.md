### Enumeration Principles
- Enumeration = Info gathering (active & passive)
- OSINT is passive and done separately
- Loop: gather info → analyze → gather more
- Targets: Domains, IPs, ports, services, vendors, structure
- Avoid brute-forcing early (noisy & weak understanding)
- Think like a treasure hunter: plan, study, don’t guess
- Key Questions:
  > What do we see? Why? What does it tell us?
  > How can we use it? What’s hidden? Why hidden? What does that mean?
- 3 Principles:
  1. More than meets the eye – look deeper
  2. Know what’s visible vs hidden
  3. Always find more – understand the target
