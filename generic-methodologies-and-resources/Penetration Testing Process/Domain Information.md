Domain info is key in pentesting — not just subdomains, but the full online presence. 
We gather passive intel to stay hidden, acting like visitors/customers.

Start by analyzing the company's main site:
- Read content carefully.
- Identify services (e.g., app dev, IoT, hosting).
- Think about the tech and structure needed behind those services.

Use third-party tools/services to gather more passive data.
Always consider both what you see and what you don’t.
Take a developer's view to understand the tech behind the services.

This passive OSINT phase offers critical insights without alerting the target.
