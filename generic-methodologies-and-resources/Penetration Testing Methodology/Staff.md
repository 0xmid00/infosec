Staff Info Gathering

Searching for employees on social media (like LinkedIn or Xing) helps us learn about a company's tech stack, team skills, and what tools/software they use.

### Job posts
Job posts show what languages, frameworks, and tools a company prefers. For example:

- Programming languages: Java, C#, C++, Python, Ruby, PHP, Perl
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle
- Frameworks: Flask, Django, Spring, ASP.NET
- Testing tools: pytest, JUnit, xUnit
- Dev practices: Agile, CI, SOA, REST APIs
- Tools: Git, SVN, Mercurial, Perforce, Atlassian (Jira, Confluence)
- Others: Docker, Kubernetes, Redis, NumPy

### employee profiles
From employee profiles:
- One profile mentions W3C specs, web components, React, Svelte, AngularJS, and GitHub projects.
- Another lists experience with Java, React, Elastic, Kafka, CRM app dev, and internal tools.

By studying these profiles and posts, we can understand:
- What technologies a company uses
- Possible security flaws (e.g. Django misconfigurations)
- Which files and structures are likely used
#### Github
Sharing projects online (GitHub, LinkedIn) can expose:
- Email addresses
- JWT tokens
- Sensitive code

Tip: Focus on devs and security staff to guess the company's tech and protection methods.
