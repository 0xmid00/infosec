## [[Samba Exploitation]]
**Samba Exploitation** refers to techniques used to discover and exploit vulnerabilities in Samba, an open-source implementation of the SMB/CIFS protocol for file and print sharing. Attackers leverage misconfigurations, outdated versions, or specific CVEs (e.g., CVE-2007-2447, CVE-2017-7494) to execute commands, traverse directories, or gain unauthorized access to systems. These exploits often result in shell access, data exfiltration
