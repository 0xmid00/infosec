# Post-Exploitation Steps:


## Information Gathering

Since we have gained a new perspective on the system and the network of our target system in the Exploitation stage, we are basically in a new environment. This means we first have to reacquaint ourselves with what we are working with and what options are available. Therefore, in the `Post-Exploitation` stage, we go through the `Information Gathering` and `Vulnerability Assessment` stages again, which we can consider as parts of the current stage. This is because the information we had up to this point was gathered from an external perspective, not an internal one.

From the inside (local) perspective, we have many more possibilities and alternatives to access certain information that is relevant to us. Therefore, the information gathering stage starts all over again from the local perspective. We search and gather as much information as we can. The difference here is that we also enumerate the local network and local services such as printers, database servers, virtualization services, etc. Often we will find shares intended for employees to use to exchange and share data and files. The investigation of these services and network components is called `Pillaging`.

##  [[Pillaging]]

Pillaging is the stage where we examine the role of the host in the corporate network. We analyze the network configurations, including but not limited to:


```
|Interfaces|Routing|DNS|
|ARP|Services|VPN|
|IP Subnets|Shares|Network Traffic|
```

`Understanding the role of the system` we are on also gives us an excellent understanding of how it communicates with other network devices and its purpose. From this, we can find out, for example, what alternative subdomains exist, whether it has multiple network interfaces, whether there are other hosts with which this system communicates, if admins are connecting to other hosts from it, and if we can potentially reuse credentials or steal an SSH key to further our access or establish persistence, etc. This helps, above all, to get an overview of the network's structure.

For example, we can use the policies installed on this system to determine what other hosts are using on the network. Because administrators often use particular schemas to secure their network and prevent users from changing anything on it. For example, suppose we discover that the password policy requires only eight characters but no special characters. In that case, we can conclude that we have a relatively high probability of guessing other users' passwords on this and other systems.

During the pillaging stage, we will also hunt for sensitive data such as passwords on shares, local machines, in scripts, configuration files, password vaults, documents (Excel, Word, .txt files, etc.), and even email.

Our main goals with pillaging are to show the impact of successful exploitation and, if we have not yet reached the goal of the assessment, to find additional data such as passwords that can be inputs to other stages such as lateral movement.

## [[Persistence]]
Once we have an overview of the system, our immediate next step is maintaining access to the exploited host. This way, if the connection is interrupted, we can still access it. This step is essential and often used as the first step before the `Information Gathering` and `Pillaging` stages.

We should follow non-standardized sequences because each system is individually configured by a unique administrator who brings their own preferences and knowledge. It is recommended that we `work flexibly` during this phase `and adapt` to the circumstances. For example, suppose we have used a buffer overflow attack on a service that is likely to crash it. In that case, we should establish persistence to the system as soon as possible to avoid having to attack the service multiple times and potentially causing a disruption. Often if we lose the connection, we will not be able to access the system in the same way.

## Vulnerability Assessment

If we can maintain access and have a good overview of the system, we can use the information about the system and its services and any other data stored on it to repeat the `Vulnerability Assessment` stage, but this time from inside the system. We analyze the information and prioritize it accordingly. The goal we pursue next is the escalation of privileges (if not already in place).

Again, it is essential to distinguish between exploits that can harm the system and attacks against the services that do not cause any disruption. In doing so, we weigh the components we have already gone through in the first Vulnerability Assessment stage.

## Privilege Escalation 
 ***( [[linux-privilege-escalation-checklist short(oscp)]] , [[checklist-windows-privilege-escalation 2]] ) and [[Persistence]]***

Privilege escalation is significant, and in most cases, it represents a critical moment that can open many more new doors for us. Getting the highest possible privileges on the system or domain is often crucial. Therefore we want to get the privileges of the `root` (on `Linux-based` systems) or the domain `administrator`/`local administrator`/`SYSTEM` (on `Windows-based` systems) because this will often allow us to move through the entire network without any restrictions.

However, it is essential to remember that the escalation of privileges does not always have to occur locally on the system. We can also obtain stored credentials during the information gathering stage from other users who are members of a higher privileged group. Exploiting these privileges to log in as another user is also part of privilege escalation because we have escalated our privileges (quickly) using the new set of credentials.

## [[Data Exfiltration]]

During the `Information Gathering` and `Pillaging` stage, we will often be able to find, among other things, considerable personal information and customer data. Some clients will want to check whether it is possible to exfiltrate these types of data. This means we try to transfer this information from the target system to our own. Security systems such as `Data Loss Prevention` (`DLP`) and `Endpoint Detection and Response` (`EDR`) help detect and prevent data exfiltration. In addition to `Network Monitoring`, many companies use encryption on hard drives to prevent external parties from viewing such information. Before exfiltrating any actual data, we should check with the customer and our manager. It can often be enough to create some bogus data (such as fake credit card numbers or social security numbers) and exfiltrate it to our system. That way, the protection mechanisms that look for patterns in data leaving the network will be tested, but we will not be responsible for any live sensitive data on our testing machine.

Companies must adhere to data security regulations depending on the type of data involved. These include, but are not limited to:

|**Type of Information**|**Security Regulation**|
|---|---|
|Credit Card Account Information|`Payment Card Industry` (`PCI`)|
|Electronic Patient Health Information|`Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act` (`HIPAA`)|
|Consumers Private Banking Information|`Gramm-Leach-Bliley` (`GLBA`)|
|Government Information|`Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002` (`FISMA`)|

Some frameworks companies may follow include:

```
|(`NIST`) - National Institute of Standards and Technology|(`CIS Controls`) - Center for Internet Security Controls|
|(`ISO`) - International Organization for Standardization|(`PCI-DSS`) - The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard|
|(`GDPR`) - General Data Protection Regulation|(`COBIT`) - Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies|
|(`FedRAMP`) - The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program|(`ITAR`) - International Traffic in Arms Regulations|
|(`AICPA`) - American Institute of Certified Public Accountants|(`NERC CIP Standards`) - NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection Standards|
```

It is worth familiarizing ourselves with each of these frameworks but what is crucial for us, however, is how we handle this information. For us, the type of data does not have much significance, but the required controls around it do, and as stated previously, we can simulate exfiltrating data from the network as a proof of concept that it is possible. We should check with the client to ensure that their systems are intended to catch the fake data type that we attempt to exfiltrate if we are successful, so we do not misrepresent anything in our report.

It's a good habit to run a screen recording (along with taking screenshots) as additional evidence for such vital steps. If we only have terminal access, we can display the hostname, IP address, user name, and the corresponding path to the customer file and take a screenshot or screen capture. This helps us prove where the data originated from and that we could remove it from the environment successfully.

If sensitive data like this is found, our client should, of course, be informed immediately. Based on the fact that we could escalate the privileges and exfiltrate personal data, they may want to pause, end, or shift the focus of the penetration test, especially if data exfiltration was the primary goal. However, this is at our client's discretion, and many will prefer that we keep testing to identify all possible weaknesses in their environment.

Next, we'll discuss lateral movement, a key stage in the penetration testing process that may use data from our post-exploitation as an input.
